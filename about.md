My name is [Rodolfo](https://twitter.com/FerroRodolfo/), but you may call me Rod. I am studying a BS in Mathematics at the [University of Guanajuato](http://www.ugto.mx/), although I've focused a bit on Computer Science.  I'm currently working on my thesis, which consists on developing an AI model to classify emotions with facial expressions in the wild. The idea is to propose a model which can be deployed in portable devices, such as a Raspberry Pi.

I am the Tech Lead and Director of [#FutureLab](https://www.facebook.com/f.lab.mx/), an innovation laboratory I co-founded with my friend [Richard](https://twitter.com/richard016) at the uni. In Future Lab we focus mainly in three things: creating, educating and networking about technological solutions to surrounding problems.

Right now, I am a [GitHub Campus Expert](https://githubcampus.expert/RodolfoFerro/) 🚩, but I have also served as a Google Student Ambassador back in 2014-2015. I like to work on tech projects that help people, which has allowed me to had a contribution to a project presented in [iGEM's Giant Jamboree](http://2016.igem.org/Team:Guanajuato_Mx) back in 2016 (we got a silver award).

In my professional development as a tech creator, I'm serving as a research assistant in the National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), working on some AI solutions for several fields involving *Human-Centered Computing* and industry. This implies some experience with image processing, data manipulation and deployment of ML models, which has also allowed me to make an internship at *Harvard University* during summer 2017, working with ML models for molecules. Besides this, I'm also part of a *public innovation* and *open government* laboratory in León, Guanajuato.

My scientific formation during college makes me feel concerned about scientific vocation of any young student in Mexico. This is why I'm a [#TeamGuanajuato](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/member/12/) comitee member of [Clubes de Ciencia México](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/), an organization which focuses in sharing science with youth, building connections between students and young scientists and designing and sharing online courses.

I love my country, I love my family and I love what I do. 🇲🇽
